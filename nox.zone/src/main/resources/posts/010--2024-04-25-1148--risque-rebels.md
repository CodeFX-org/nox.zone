What a show that was!
To avoid net censoring algos, this video is tame, but the full footage?
Oh my, even the data shards containing it are still wet and hard, so if you're in Neo and need a hit, come find me.

Or better yet, go watch their upcoming shows on Friday:
At 4pm they'll be in Station Z and at 10pm you can grab them in Maintenance Bay 54 - don't forget our entry token for that one.

Until then, keep fighting.
