I got a hot tip to look into Helix Industries' mining of Promethium and it leads to Neotropolis, a chickenshit outpost on Kepler-609c in the Cygnus constellation.
Helix is pulling the strings there and is apparently involved in some dark shit.
Time to shine a light!

A contact came through and got me a posting as a worker on Helix' latest investment: Megablock 1.
I'll catch the next transport out.
