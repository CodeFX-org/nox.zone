Out in the far reaches of the Cygnus Constellation lies the Cygnus Federation of Systems, a loose collection of planets in disputed galactic territory.
One of those planets is Kepler-609c and its lone settlement is Neotropolis, formerly just a small trading outpost.

When trace elements of Promethium were discovered in the planet's soil and its rings, Helix Industries set up mining operations on Kepler's polar cap and its planetary rings.
Helix also took over control of Neotropolis and built out its spaceport to ship the refined Promethium through there.

But not everybody in Neo took this lying down and there's a lot happening in its shadows.
