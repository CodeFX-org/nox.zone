This is Radio Nox with a Neotropolis map reveal.

I still couldn't get a camera into Megablock 1, but I got something on this shard that's almost as good: a map of the block, lifted off of Helix's server just a few hours ago.
So this is Neotropolis and in case you're looking for me, my transport module is on 1st close to the corner to Beta.

Over on the midtown plaza you will see the landmark radio tower of the Wayward Communication Corp, the megamall, and the epic Kaiju nightclub, your first address if you need a discrete place to meet your shadowy contacts while having a good time.
Across from it is the megablock your one stop shop for gunning up, for finding infos or jobs or runners who do your jobs for you.
Endline Solutions has their office here just like Exus and the Sentient Liberation Front.
This is the beating heart of Neotropolis and I greased a few wheels and am confident I can get you footage from the inside within the next 24 hours.
Until then, keep fighting.
